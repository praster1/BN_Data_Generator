Title: Data Generator based on Bayesian Network Model
Author: Jae-seong Yoo
Maintainer: Jae-seong Yoo <praster1@gmail.com>
Depends: R (>= 3.0.0)
Suggests: bnlearn
Description: Previous tools suffer from serious trade-off between cost and complexity, restricting most studies relevant to Bayesian network to using only real data. To address such problem, a data generator based on Bayesian network model using R is built and introduced.
