~~~~Based on the Grow-Shrink Markov blanket, the simplest Markov blanket detection algorithm (Margaritis D., 2003) used in a structure learning algorithm.

The definition of a Markov blanket is as follows: for any variable $X \in U$, the Markov blanket $BL(X) \subseteq U$ is any set of variables such that for any $Y \in U - BL(X) - \{X\}, X \perp Y | BL(X)$. In other words, $BL(X)$ completely "shields" (d-separates) variable $X$ from any other variable outside $BL(X) \cup \{X\}$.

In a Bayesian network graph, the Markov blanket of a node includes its parents, children and other parents of all of its children.

GS, for the recovery of the Markov blanket of $X$ is based on pairwise independent tests. It consists of two phases, a growing and a shrinking one. Starting from an empty set $S$, the growing phase adds variables to $S$ as long as they are dependent with $X$ given the current contents of $S$.
