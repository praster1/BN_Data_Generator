~~~~Previous tools suffer from a serious trade-off between cost and complexity, restricting most studies relevant to Bayesian network to using only real data.

Therefore, in this paper, have been widely used so far, for the BN demonstration model, I tried to first apply the algorithm.

However, in order to measure the objective performance of the algorithm, it is necessary to try to analyze the synthetic data. Therefore, in this paper, by using the data generator BN that introduced, after generating the synthetic data in accordance with the topology, and algorithms were attempted to be applied to this.

In order to avoid the influence of chance, all experiments are repeated 100 times, and overall results are reported.
