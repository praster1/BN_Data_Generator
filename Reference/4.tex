~~~~If given a Bayesian network model, then we can make a data set based on the model. However, it does not provide data by \textbf{bnlearn}, and in addition, it was difficult to find other functions. This makes it very hard work to create data in \textbf{R}. Other tools suffer from the trade-off between cost and complexity, restricting most studies relevant to Bayesian network to using only real data.

To address such problems, a data generator based on the Bayesian network model using R is built and introduced. At present, it exists as R functional form, but here are plans to make an R package.
