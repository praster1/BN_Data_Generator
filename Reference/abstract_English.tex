In this paper, we compare the performance between the Bayesian network structure learning algorithm provided by \textbf{bnlearn} package in \textbf{R}.

The performance of the study results is evaluated by using a score method comparing between the target network and the learning network. In this paper, it was confirmed that algorithm specific performance test results using fore-mentioned methods are different.

Unlike most previous studies which generally used real data, synthetic data generated based on topology was used to compare performance of contrast-specific algorithm. The aim of this paper is to provide objective guidance of selecting suitable algorithm in accordance to target network.

Previous tools suffer from serious trade-off between cost and complexity, restricting most studies relevant to Bayesian network to using only real data. To address such problem, a data generator based on Bayesian network model using \textbf{R} is built and introduced.
