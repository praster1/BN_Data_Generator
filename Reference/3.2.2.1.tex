~~~~The \textbf{$\log$-likelihood (LL) Score} is defined in the following way:
$$LL(B|T)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{q_{i}}\sum_{k=1}^{r_{i}}N_{ijk}\log(\frac{N_{ijk}}{N_{ij}}).$$

The LL score tends to favor complete network structures and it does not provide an useful representation of the independence assumptions of the learned network.

This phenomenon of overfitting is usually avoided in two different ways:

\begin{itemize}
	\item By limiting the number of parents per network variable.
	
	\item By using some penalization factor over the LL score : AIC, BIC
\end{itemize}
