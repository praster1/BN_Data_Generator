~~~~A Hill-climbing is a greedy search on the space of the directed graphs. The optimized implementation uses score caching, score decomposability and score equivalence to reduce the number of duplicated tests.

It is simply a loop that continually moves in the direction of increasing value. The algorithm does not maintain a search tree, so the data structure for the current node only needs to record the state and the value of the objective function. Hill-climbing does not look beyond the immediate neighbors of the current state. This resembles trying to find the top of Mount Everest in a thick fog while suffering from amnesia. (Russell S.
