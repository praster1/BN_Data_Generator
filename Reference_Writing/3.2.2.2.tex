The measure of the quality of a BN can be computed in several different ways:

$$\phi(B|T) = LL(B|T) - f(N)|B|,$$

where $f(N)$ is a non-negative penalization function.

\begin{itemize}
	\item If f(N) = 1, we have the \textbf{Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)} scoring function:
	
	$$AIC(B|T) = LL(B|T) - |B|.$$
	
	\item If $f(N) = \frac{1}{2} \log(N)$, we have the \textbf{Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)} score.
	
	\item If $f(N) = 0$, we have the LL score.
\end{itemize}
