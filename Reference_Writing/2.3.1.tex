~~~~A hybrid algorithm which combines the Max-Min Parents and Children algorithm (to restrict the search space) and the Hill-Climbing algorithm (to find the optimal network structure in the restricted space). (Tsamardinos I. \emph{et al.} 2006)

The algorithm first identifies the parents and children set of each variable, then performs a greedy hill-climbing search in the space of Bayesian networks. The search begins with an empty graph. The edge addition, deletion, or direction reversal that leads to the largest increase in score is taken and the search continues in a similar fashion recursively.
