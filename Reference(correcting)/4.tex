~~~~If given a Bayesian network models, then we can make data set based on model. However, it does not provide by \textbf{bnlearn}, in addition, it was difficult to find other functions. It makes very hard work to create data in \textbf{R}. Other tools suffer from serious trade off between cost and complexity, restricting most studies relevant to Bayesian network to using only real data.

To address such problem, a data generator based on Bayesian network model using R is built and introduced. At present, exists as R functional form, and it is planning to make an R package. It  published an update on the current status at https://github.com/praster1/BN$\_$Data$\_$Generator. This generator was declared the GNU 2.0 license.
