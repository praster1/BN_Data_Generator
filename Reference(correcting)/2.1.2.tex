IAMB consists of two phases, a forward and a backward one.

The Markov blanket of a variable of interest $T$, will be denotes as $MB(T)$. An estimate of the $MB(T)$ is kept in the set $S$. In the forward phase all variables that belong in $MB(T)$ and possibly more (false positives) enter $S$ while in the backward phase the false positives are identified and removed so that $S = MB(T)$ in the end.
